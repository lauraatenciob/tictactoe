#  Tic Tac Toe

This is my first project using React JS. I built it following the official React site tutorial. However, I made a few changes to understand it better and give it my personal touch.

This application is deployed to GitHub Pages. You can check it out [here](https://lauraatenciob.github.io/tictactoe/).
